If you want develop with Kivy:
1. Download PIP if you don't have it. It's basically an easy way to install Python packages. 
2. Download Kivy from here https://kivy.org/#download
3. Take a look at this https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdNh1e1kmiPP4YApJm8ENK2yMlwF1_edq if you want to which teaches you how to code basic stuff in Kivy. Ignore video 2 though. I'll do the compilation stuff and the making of the actual APK.
