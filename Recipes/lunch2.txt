Method:
1.Put a griddle pan on a high heat. In a bowl, cover the noodles with boiling kettle water to rehydrate them. Use a sharp knife to slice into the chicken breasts, then open each one out flat like a book. Rub with 1 teaspoon of groundnut oil and a small pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then griddle for 8 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning halfway.
2.Trim the spring onions and rattle them through the finest slicer on your food processor, followed by the Chinese cabbage, sugar snap peas and chilli. Dress with the juice of 1 lime and the soy sauce. In a small bowl, mix the peanut butter with the yoghurt and the juice of the remaining lime, peel and finely grate in the ginger, mix again, taste, and season to perfection.
3.Remove the chicken to a board and slice, lightly toasting the sesame seeds in the residual heat of the griddle pan and sprinkling them over the chicken before serving. Drain the noodles, divide between your plates with the chicken, slaw and peanut sauce, mix it all up and tuck on in.
