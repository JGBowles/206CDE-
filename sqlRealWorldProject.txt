Sql statments required for real world project

first connect to database:

import sqlite3 as sql
con = sql.connect('skiSlopeDatabase.db') #connecting to sql
cur = con.cursor()
N.B cur stands for cursor and con stands for connection

and remember to commit and close the connection once all sql is execute (only close at end and commit after each insert)

con.commit
con.close()

inserting user details into database:

first use get commands to get infomation form gui entry boxes and put them into a list in order
customerDetails = [userID,username,password,email,phone_number]

cur.execute('''BookingList (userID,username,password,email,phone_number) VALUES (?,?,?,?,?);''', customerDetails)

what this does is it inserts the data into the database a ? is a placholder and is needed when inerting values that are vairbles created in the code

Now selecting data to be put in the shopping list, first it is necessary to get the name of the recipe when the user selects the recipe
to add to the shopping list:

firstly select the recipe id based on recipe name

cur.execute('''SELECT recipeID FROM recipes WHERE recipeName = ?;''',recipeName) #select recipe id based on name of recipe
recipeID = int(fetchone()[0]) #asign recipe id 

then we have to select the ingredients based on the recipe id:

cur.execute('''SELECT * FROM  ingredients WHERE recipeID = ? ;''',recipeID) #this selects all the ingredients in the database with that recipe id
